What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git sets up a hidden directory .git to track revisions and metadata.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

Having the staging area as an intermediary between the working directory and the repository
allows the user more control over what is included in the commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

You can use the command git diff --staged to check your staged commit vs. the last commit to confirm
that you included only one logical change.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

When you want to create a separate version of the software, i.e. an easy-mode or different language.
Branches allow you to maintain distinct modified versions of the project.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

Git is not user-friendly on a visual basis, so diagrams help quite a bit to track multiple branches.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

The result of merging two branches together is a new commit that contains the sum of the additions
and deletions from the two branches using the branch point as the reference.

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?

Automatic merging saves time and effort, but cannot resolve all issues.  Manual merging allows the
coders to determine the optimal solution.
