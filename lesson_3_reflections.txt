When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    1) When you are collaborating on a project; 2) as a backup to your local files; 3) to make the source 
	code available to others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    If you are starting from a stable codebase that you don't want to muddle up.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    A fork is a remote clone of a repo.  A clone is a local copy of a repo, either local or remote.
	A branch is a modification from the "master" codebase.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

	So you can determine what changes have been made with your local branch via git diff.

and what would be harder?
